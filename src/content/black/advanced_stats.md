# Black Belt: Advanced Data Analysis

## Design of Experiments (DOE)
DOE is a structured, active method of manipulating factors to see their effect on the output (Y).
- **Full Factorial**: Testing every possible combination.
- **Fractional Factorial**: Testing a subset to save time/cost while still getting key insights.

## Regression Analysis
Creating a mathematical equation (Y = f(X)) to predict outcomes.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: One X.
- **Multiple Regression**: Multiple X variables.
- **R-Squared**: Tells you how much of the variation is explained by your model.

## Non-Normal Data
What happens when your data doesn't follow a bell curve?
- **Transformations**: Box-Cox or Johnson transformations to make data normal.
- **Non-Parametric Tests**: Mood's Median or Mann-Whitney tests.
