# Black Belt: Leadership & Change Management

## The Soft Side of Six Sigma
70% of projects fail due to "people issues," not technical ones.

## Stakeholder Management
- **Power/Interest Grid**: Identifying who needs to be managed closely vs. kept informed.
- **ARMI Model**: Approver, Resource, Member, Interested Party.

## Organizational Deployment
- **Hoshin Kanri**: Policy deployment that aligns the entire company to specific breakthrough goals.
- **Theory of Constraints (TOC)**: Identifying the "bottleneck" in the system and optimizing around it.
