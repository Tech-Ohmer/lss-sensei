# Green Belt: Advanced DMAIC & Statistics

## The Green Belt Role
As a Green Belt, you lead projects and provide data-driven insights. This level introduces the statistical power behind Six Sigma.

## Basic Statistics for Green Belts
- **Mean**: The average.
- **Median**: The middle value.
- **Standard Deviation (Sigma)**: The measure of variation.
- **Normal Distribution**: The "Bell Curve" where most data points cluster around the mean.

## Process Capability (Cp & Cpk)
- **Cp**: Potential capability (can the process fit within specs if centered?).
- **Cpk**: Actual capability (how well is the process actually performing relative to the specs?).
- **Target**: A Cpk of 1.33 or higher is generally considered "capable."

## Hypothesis Testing (Intro)
Using data to prove if a change is statistically significant or just due to chance.
- **P-Value**: If p < 0.05, the result is statistically significant (we reject the Null Hypothesis).
