# Green Belt: Analyze & Improve

## Multi-Vari Analysis
Looking at multiple variables to see how they interact. Is the variation coming from position (within-unit), cyclically (unit-to-unit), or temporally (time-to-time)?

## Correlation vs. Causation
- **Correlation**: Two variables move together.
- **Causation**: One variable *causes* the other to change.
- *Remember: Correlation does not imply causation.*

## FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
A proactive tool to identify how a process might fail.
- **Severity**: How bad is the failure?
- **Occurrence**: How often does it happen?
- **Detection**: How likely are we to catch it?
- **RPN (Risk Priority Number)**: Severity x Occurrence x Detection. High RPNs must be addressed first.
