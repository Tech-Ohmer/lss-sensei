# Welcome to Six Sigma

Six Sigma is more than just a certificate; it's a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects (driving toward six standard deviations between the mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process—from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service.

## The Goal
The fundamental objective of Six Sigma is the implementation of a measurement-based strategy that focuses on **process improvement** and **variation reduction**.

## What is "Six Sigma"?
Statistically, Six Sigma means having no more than **3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO)**.

## The Two Key Methodologies
1. **DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control. (Used for improving existing processes).
2. **DMADV**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify. (Used for creating new processes/products).
