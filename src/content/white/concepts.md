# Basic Concepts

## Voice of the Customer (VOC)
VOC is the term used to describe the in-depth process of capturing a customer's expectations, preferences, and aversions.

## Critical to Quality (CTQ)
CTQs are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met to satisfy the customer.

## Variation
Variation is the enemy of quality. It is the fluctuation in process output.
- **Common Cause Variation**: Natural, inherent variation in the process.
- **Special Cause Variation**: Unusual, assignable variation (e.g., machine breakdown).

## The 7 Wastes (Muda)
1. **Transportation**: Moving products unnecessarily.
2. **Inventory**: Storing parts, pieces, documentation ahead of requirements.
3. **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people.
4. **Waiting**: Waiting for the next step in production.
5. **Overproduction**: Making more than is immediately required.
6. **Overprocessing**: Doing more work than necessary (e.g., painting unseen areas).
7. **Defects**: Rework, scrap, or incorrect documentation.
