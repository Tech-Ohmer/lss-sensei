# The Define Phase

## Goal
The goal of the Define phase is to articulate the business problem, goal, potential resources, project scope, and high-level project timeline.

## Key Deliverable: The Project Charter
A Project Charter is a contract between the project team and the champion/sponsor. It includes:
1. **Problem Statement**: What is wrong, where, when, and how much? (Must be quantifiable).
2. **Business Case**: Why is this project worth doing? What is the financial impact?
3. **Goal Statement**: How much will we improve? By when?
4. **Scope**: What is IN and OUT of the project?
5. **Team Members**: Roles and responsibilities.
6. **Timeline**: Key milestones.
