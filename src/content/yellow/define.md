# The Define Phase: Crafting the Roadmap

In the Yellow Belt, you stop being an observer and start being a **contributor**. The Define phase is where you set the "North Star" for your project.

## The Project Charter: Your "Contract"
A Six Sigma project without a charter is a ship without a compass. It defines the **Business Case**—the "So What?" of your work.

### 🚀 Case Study: Surgery Wait Times
**The Problem**: Patients at a city hospital waited 4 hours for registration.
**The Define Phase**: 
- **Scope**: Registration process from door-entry to bed-assignment.
- **Goal**: Reduce wait time by 50% within 3 months.
- **Financial Impact**: Estimated $200k savings in staff overtime and patient attrition.

## SIPOC: The Bird's Eye View

## Sample Project Idea (Yellow Belt)
**"Meeting Efficiency Audit"**
Define the waste in your team's weekly meetings. Use SIPOC to map the inputs (Agenda, Data) and Outputs (Decisions, Action Items). Your goal: Reduce "Motion" and "Waiting" waste.
