# The Analyze Phase

## Goal
The goal of the Analyze phase is to identify, validate, and select the root cause for elimination.

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Tools

### 1. Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)
A visual tool for categorizing potential causes of a problem. Categories often used (6 Ms):
- **Man** (People)
- **Machine**
- **Material**
- **Method**
- **Measurement**
- **Mother Nature** (Environment)

### 2. The 5 Whys
A simple but powerful tool for drilling down to the root cause. Ask "Why?" five times until you reach the fundamental reason.

### 3. Pareto Chart (80/20 Rule)
A bar chart that prioritizes causes. It is based on the Pareto Principle: **80% of effects come from 20% of causes.** Focus on the "Vital Few" over the "Trivial Many."
