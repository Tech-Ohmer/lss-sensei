# The Control Phase

## Goal
The goal of the Control phase is to sustain the gains. Monitor the improvements to ensure continued success.

## Control Plans
A document describing the critical characteristics of the process and how they will be monitored.

## Control Charts (SPC)
Statistical Process Control charts are used to monitor stability.
- **Upper Control Limit (UCL)** & **Lower Control Limit (LCL)**: Calculated limits (usually +/- 3 sigma from mean).
- **Out of Control**: Points outside limits or specific non-random patterns (runs, trends).

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Documented procedures ensure consistency. Everyone performs the task the same way.

## Poka-Yoke (Mistake Proofing)
Designing the process so that mistakes are impossible or immediately detected (e.g., a USB plug that only fits one way).
