# The Improve Phase

## Goal
The goal of the Improve phase is to identify, test, and implement a solution to the problem; in part or in whole.

## Generating Solutions
- **Brainstorming**: Generating a large number of creative ideas.
- **Benchmarking**: Looking at best-in-class processes outside your industry.

## Selecting Solutions
- **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**: A 2x2 grid to prioritize quick wins (High Impact, Low Effort).
- **Pugh Matrix**: A criteria-based decision matrix.

## Piloting
Testing the solution on a small scale before full implementation. This minimizes risk and allows for refinement.
