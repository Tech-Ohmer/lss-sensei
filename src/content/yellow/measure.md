# The Measure Phase

## Goal
The goal of the Measure phase is to objectively establish current baselines as the basis for improvement.

## Process Mapping
Detailed visual representation of the process flow.
- **Top-Down Chart**: High-level view.
- **Swimlane Map**: Shows who does what (hand-offs).
- **Value Stream Map (VSM)**: Shows material and information flow, highlighting value-added vs. non-value-added steps.

## Data Types
Understanding data is critical for Six Sigma.
1. **Continuous Data**: Measured on a continuous scale (e.g., time, weight, height). Can be infinitely divided. *Preferred for analysis.*
2. **Discrete Data**: Counted data.
    - **Binary**: Yes/No, Pass/Fail.
    - **Ordinal**: Ranked (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).
    - **Nominal**: Categories (e.g., Red, Blue, Green).

## Measurement System Analysis (MSA)
Ensures that your data is trustworthy. Are you measuring the right thing correctly? Is the measurement system repeatable and reproducible (Gage R&R)?
