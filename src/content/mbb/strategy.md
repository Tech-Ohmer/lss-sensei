# Master Black Belt: Strategic Deployment

## Enterprise-Wide Transformation
The MBB doesn't just lead projects; they lead the *program*.

## Strategic Project Selection
- **Alignment**: Every project must support a Top-Level Business Metric (KPI).
- **Financial Validation**: Working with Finance to verify hard vs. soft savings.

## Coaching & Mentoring
- **Training**: Developing the curriculum for Green and Black Belts.
- **Project Reviews**: Serving as the technical gatekeeper for certifications.

## Lean Leadership
Creating a culture of continuous improvement.
- **Gemba Walks**: Going to the "actual place" where work is done to observe and learn.
- **Kaikaku**: Radical, revolutionary change (opposite of Kaizen's incremental change).
